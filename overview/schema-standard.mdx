The hydric Schema is the technical realization of our **Primitive-Centric** vision. It is the fixed contract between our Gateway Layer and your application.

By adhering to a strict schema standard, we ensure that your integration logic remains unchanged, regardless of the underlying protocol version or chain architecture.

## Standard Principles

- **Type Safety:** Every field is strictly typed and deterministic.
- **Semantic Consistency:** A field named `totalValueLocked` or `yield` means the same thing in a V2 Pool as it does in a V4 Pool, as it does in a Lending Market.
- **Explicit Units:** All numerical values are returned in standardized formats (e.g., USD-denominated values and raw BigInt strings for on-chain units).

## Liquidity Pools Base Schema

The hydric Liquidity Pool model is the standardized representation of the Exchange Primitive. Every pool indexed by hydric, from legacy V2 forks to V4 deployments, conforms to this unified structure.

### Why we use a Unified Schema

By abstracting the underlying protocol nuances into a single contract, we allow your application to remain logic-agnostic while ensuring total data consistency.
