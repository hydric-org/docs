description: "A normalized data layer for accessing DeFi liquidity without protocol-specific expertise."
---

## Overview

hydric is a **protocol-agnostic data layer** that provides normalized, derived, and queryable financial data across the DeFi ecosystem.

It allows applications to interact with DeFi liquidity using a **single semantic model**, without needing to understand how individual protocols implement pools, lending markets, staking mechanisms, or yield calculations.

hydric does not execute transactions, manage funds, or optimize strategies.  
It provides the **data intelligence required** for those systems to operate reliably.

## The Problem hydric Solves

DeFi protocols expose state in fundamentally different ways.

To integrate even a small set of protocols, teams must:

- Decode protocol-specific smart contract logic
- Reconstruct state from heterogeneous events
- Implement custom math for yields, liquidity, and rates
- Maintain protocol-specific indexers and assumptions

This work scales linearly with each new integration and introduces hidden correctness risks.

hydric removes this burden by centralizing protocol research, state reconstruction, and semantic normalization into a single system.

## What hydric Provides

hydric exposes DeFi liquidity through a **unified API and schema**, enabling applications to reason about financial primitives instead of protocol internals.

### Unified Access Layer

- One API to access liquidity data across chains, protocols, and versions
- Consistent schemas for pools, lending markets, and staking positions
- Protocol-agnostic identifiers and relationships

### Normalized Financial Semantics

hydric does not expose raw protocol state.

Instead, it provides:

- Normalized representations of liquidity, yield, and exposure
- Derived metrics with documented assumptions
- Comparable data across heterogeneous implementations

A Uniswap V3 pool and a lending market may differ internally, but their liquidity and yield characteristics are expressed consistently at the data layer.

## Supported Primitives

### Liquidity Pools

- Liquidity depth and utilization
- Volume and fee-derived yield
- Protocol-specific parameters required for safe interaction
- Support for concentrated liquidity designs (e.g. V3, V4)

### Lending & Credit _(Planned)_

- Borrow and supply rates
- Market utilization and health metrics
- Collateral and liquidation parameters

### Staking & Yield _(Planned)_

- Normalized yield metrics
- Entry and exit constraints
- Vault-specific behavior abstracted into a standard model

## The hydric Engine

hydric is built as a deterministic data pipeline:

1. **Ingest**  
   Indexers track on-chain state directly from smart contracts, capturing authoritative protocol data.

2. **Normalize**  
   Protocol-specific events and state transitions are translated into the hydric Schema using defined rules and assumptions.

3. **Serve**  
   Data is exposed through a high-performance API, optimized for filtering, sorting, and composability.

Derived values are reproducible from indexed state and documented logic.

## What hydric Is Not

To avoid ambiguity, hydric explicitly does **not**:

- Execute transactions
- Route orders or optimize strategies
- Act as a price oracle
- Manage wallets or user funds
- Replace protocol governance or risk parameters

hydric is infrastructure, not an execution or decision layer.

## Intended Use

hydric is designed for:

- DeFi frontends and dashboards
- Backend services integrating on-chain liquidity
- Risk, analytics, and portfolio systems
- Fintech and treasury platforms consuming DeFi data

It is optimized for teams that want **reliable, comparable DeFi data** without maintaining protocol-specific infrastructure.

## Goal

hydric’s goal is to make DeFi liquidity **readable, comparable, and usable** through a single, consistent data model.

When applications can reason about liquidity without protocol expertise, DeFi becomes infrastructure instead of research.
