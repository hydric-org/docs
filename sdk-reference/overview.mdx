The hydric Gateway SDK is a lightweight wrapper for the [hydric Gateway API](https://api.hydric.org). It handles network requests, authentication, and response parsing, allowing you to focus on your application logic.

## Architecture

The SDK follows a **Resource-based pattern**, where functionality is grouped into logical modules accessible via the main `hydric` client.

### Core Resources

- **`multichainTokens`**: Aggregate data across all supported blockchains. Ideal for dashboards and cross-chain portfolio views.
- **`singleChainTokens`**: Optimized for speed and targeted operations on a specific network.
- **`tokenBaskets`**: Access curated lists of tokens maintained by the hydric team.

## Supported Languages

| Language            | Status                                              | Package                            |

## Core Concepts

### Authentication

All requests require a valid API key. This key is set once during initialization and handled automatically by the client.

### Error Handling

The SDK uses specialized error classes (e.g., `HydricRateLimitError`, `HydricNotFoundError`) to help you handle failures gracefully without parsing string messages.

### Versioning

We follow strict Semantic Versioning (SemVer). Updates to the gateway API that require SDK changes will be released as new versions of the SDK to ensure stability for your production apps.
