Welcome to the **hydric Gateway SDK**, the most efficient way to integrate multi-chain DeFi data into your applications.

hydric acts as a high-performance abstraction layer over fragmented blockchain data. Instead of managing complex GraphQL queries, RPC calls, and cross-chain indexers, you use a single, unified interface to access curated, verified, and real-time liquidity data.

## Why hydric?

In a multi-chain world, liquidity is fragmented across hundreds of protocols and dozens of networks. Developers often face significant hurdles:

- **Data Fragmentation:** Different chains have different indexing standards.
- **Complexity:** Managing multiple RPC nodes and GraphQL endpoints is a DevOps nightmare.
- **Accuracy:** Calculating real-time TVL and liquidity across chains is error-prone.

**hydric solves this by providing a unified gateway.** One API, one SDK, and zero headaches.

## Design Philosophy

The hydric SDK is built with three core pillars in mind:

1. **The Junior Test:** A developer with basic knowledge should be able to make their first successful request in under 60 seconds.
2. **Predictable Performance:** We clearly distinguish between high-performance single-chain operations and powerful (but heavier) multi-chain aggregations.
3. **Fail Fast & Loud:** Descriptive error messages ensure you spend less time debugging and more time building.
