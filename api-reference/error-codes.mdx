## API Status Codes

The status codes returned by the API are the same as the HTTP status codes, like `200`, `400`, `500`, etc. [Don't know about http status codes?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

## Custom Error Codes by hydric

for every error, hydric returns a custom code to make it easier to handle custom errors in your side. for example `LIQUIDITY_POOL_NOT_FOUND`.
