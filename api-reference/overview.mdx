<Note>
  **Private Beta:** hydric is currently accessible to a select group of
  partners. To request access to our infrastructure, please reach out to our
  [Engineering Support](mailto:support@hydric.org).
</Note>

The hydric Gateway API is a high-performance REST interface designed for deterministic access to normalized DeFi liquidity data. All endpoints are served over HTTPS and return standard JSON payloads.

## Gateway URL

The hydric Gateway API is globally distributed at:

| Environment    | Base URL                    |
| :------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **Production** | `https://api.hydric.org/v1` |

## Response Architecture

Every request to the hydric Gateway Layer follows a consistent response structure. Our goal is to provide actionable intelligence that can be parsed safely in production environments.

### Success Patterns

All successful responses return a `200 OK` status. Data is always encapsulated in a top-level object to allow for future metadata expansion without breaking your integration.

### Error Handling

When a request cannot be fulfilled, hydric returns a structured error object. We provide deep context to ensure that your automated systems can handle failures gracefully.

**Error Schema:**

- **`status`**: The standard HTTP status code.
- **`code`**: A machine-readable hydric-specific error string (e.g., `INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY_DATA`).
- **`message`**: A concise, human-readable summary of the issue.
- **`details`**: Technical hints, suggestions, or stack-trace fragments to accelerate debugging.
- **`metadata`**: Context-specific data, such as the specific input value that triggered a validation failure.

For a complete mapping of error types and recovery strategies, see the [Error Codes](/api-reference/error-codes) documentation.

## Implementation Rules

To ensure system stability and fair access for all partners, the following rules apply to all Gateway interactions:

- **Content Type:** All requests must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.
- **Rate Limiting:** Every API key is subject to a rate limit. Exceeding this limit will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.
- **Versioning:** The API is versioned via the URL (e.g., `/v1`). Breaking changes will never be introduced to an existing version.
